Question 1.

```{r}
set.seed(100)

titanic_split <- initial_split(titanic, prop = 0.70, strata = survived)

titanic_train <- training(titanic_split)
titanic_test <- testing(titanic_split)

tr <- nrow(titanic_train) # determine number of observations
tt <- nrow(titanic_test) # determine number of observations

print(tr/(tr+tt))

titanic_train # look at training data
```
There appears to be some missing data regarding the age of some passengers. It is a good idea to use stratified sampling for this data since the purpose of the model is to predict survival categorizations. By stratifying the data on the survival variable, there exists a similar proportion of each categorization in the training and testing sets which allows for a more effective model.
