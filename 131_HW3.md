Question 1.

``` r
set.seed(100)

titanic_split <- initial_split(titanic, prop = 0.70, strata = survived)

titanic_train <- training(titanic_split)
titanic_test <- testing(titanic_split)

tr <- nrow(titanic_train) # determine number of observations
tt <- nrow(titanic_test) # determine number of observations

print(tr/(tr+tt))
```

There appears to be some missing data regarding the age of some
passengers as well as the cabin number. It is a good idea to use
stratified sampling for this data since the purpose of the model is to
predict survival categorizations. By stratifying the data on the
survival variable, there exists a similar proportion of each
categorization in the training and testing sets which allows for a more
effective model.

Question 2.

``` r
ggplot(titanic_train, aes(x=survived)) + geom_bar()
```

![](131_HW3_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

The distribution of the outcome variable in the training set indicates
that between 3/2 and double the amount of people who survived did not
survive.

Question 3.

``` r
cor_titanic <- titanic_train %>%
  select(is.numeric) %>%
  correlate()
```

    ## Warning: Predicate functions must be wrapped in `where()`.
    ## 
    ##   # Bad
    ##   data %>% select(is.numeric)
    ## 
    ##   # Good
    ##   data %>% select(where(is.numeric))

Age and siblings/spouses are negatively correlated as well as
parents/children and age. Parents/children and siblings/spouses, fare
and siblings/spouses, and fare and parents/children are positively
correlated.

Question 4.

``` r
titanic_recipe <- recipe(survived ~ pclass + sex + age + sib_sp + parch + fare, data = titanic_train)
```
